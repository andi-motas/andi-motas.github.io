                Hi there, I'm Andi. I'm a rising junior majoring in computer science and minoring in art and visual technology. My experience includes proficiency in Java, intermediate proficiency in C, and knowledge of Python from a few projects. I aspire to be a programmer because I would like a career that involves creative thinking and problem solving. My dream is to develop software that helps creators bring their ideas to life.
                
                Outside of programming, I like to play instruments, make art, volunteer, enjoy food with people, and learn about the plethora of things I find interesting.
                
                Thanks for stopping by!
        </p>
