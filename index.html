                Hi there, I'm Andi. I'm a rising junior majoring in computer science and minoring in art and visual technology. I'm looking for an on-campus job for the school year and an internship in the DMV area for the summer.

                My experience includes proficiency in Java, intermediate proficiency in C, and knowledge of Python from a few projects. I aspire to be a programmer because I would like a career that involves creative thinking and problem solving. My dream is to develop software that helps creators bring their ideas to life.
                
                Outside of programming, I like to play instruments, make art, volunteer, enjoy food with people, and learn about the plethora of things I find interesting.
                
                Thanks for stopping by!
        </p>
